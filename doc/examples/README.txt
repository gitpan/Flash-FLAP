1. The "cpu" directory contains an example of simple registration that returns a complex data structure (array of hashes). The Flash movies shows a bar chart of the current server load as reported by uptime.

2. The "datagrid" directory is an example of using an advanced GUI control in a Flash movie.

3. The "basic" directory shows how data is passed from the client to the server and back. This example employs the advanced service registration when you register a directory and all Perl packages in that directory are automatically considered as services.
