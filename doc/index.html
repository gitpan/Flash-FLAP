      <h2>Updates</h2>
        Apr 14, 2003 - FLAP renamed to Flash::FLAP. Version 0.03 uploaded. Added ser
vice discovery - now you can register a directory and put Perl packages in it. Every
 package will be considered a service. Macromedia Service Browser support added.

<br>
<br>
	Mar 11, 2003 - FLAP-0.02 uploaded. Verified trasfer of basic data types from Flash to Perl. Parameters are now sent to Perl functions as an array, not an array ref.
<p>	Mailing list on SourceForge is set up. Please <a href=http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/flaph-general>go here to subscribe</a>.
      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <h3> Short version<br>
      </h3>
      <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashremoting/">Flash
Remoting</a> is a way for Flash movies running in a web browser to
request structured data from the web server. The following data types
are supported - strings, numbers, dates, arrays, dictionaries/hashes,
objects, recordsets. Flash clients talk with the server using the AMF
protocol, which is proprietary to Macromedia. However, it's not that
hard to decode. <br>
      <br>
Using even the first version of FLAP, it is possible to send arbitrary
data between client and server using very few lines of code. There is no
need to pack complicated data structures into CGI form parameteres or
XML strings. The coding time can be spent on better things - data
preparation and graphical presentation, not data delivery.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Long version</h3>
HTML forms are ugly. HTML itself is not well suited for presenting
data. Everybody knows that but still uses them. However, the Rich
Internet Client is back and it gets adopted more and         more. In
part this has to do with Macromedia's eforts. <br>
      <br>
Macromedia Flash has matured enough to <br>
a) allow developers to build rich, visually attractive user interfaces
and <br>
b) receive data from the server in a convenient way.<br>
      <p>But if you believe in the idea of more and more programmers
taking a shot at developing clients in Flash, you must also see the need
for a good data gateway between web clients (the Flash movie) and web
servers. Macromedia offers just that in Macromedia Flash Remoting,
available for ColdFusion, JRun, .NET, J2EE. </p>
      <p>The Macromedia development tools are neither free nor
open-source. The server costs go into thousands. (There are
fully-fuctional trial versions available, though.)<br>
However, by using Perl to implement the server-side part of the
gateway, that part of the solution becomes free.<br>
      </p>
      <p> <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashremoting/">Flash
Remoting</a> protocol (AMF) is similar to SOAP, but the protocol
complexities are hidden from the developer. On the client side you call
a local function, and your call is passed to the corresponding function
on the server. Another function, a callback, is invoked by the framework
when the data is received. On the server side you provide a handler
with a certain name that registers certain functions, available to be
used by the client. Everything on the server side is within the syntax
of the server language. The client side uses ActionScript. <a
 href="code.html">This is what the code looks like.</a><br>
      </p>
      <p>We think that it is very important for the Open Source
community to make this technology available in Perl and (why not?) in
Python as well. We set out to decode the protocol, but soon discovered
that <a href="http://amfphp.sourceforge.net/">PHP folks</a> beat us by a
month, so we simply rewrote their code in Perl.</p>
We would like to hear the community feedback - the amount of time we
will put into this project will be proportional to the need for it.<br>
